Learned Matplotlib basics:

    Created line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms.
    Added titles, labels, and customized plots.

Learned Seaborn basics:

    Created advanced statistical plots easily.
    Used scatterplot, histplot, boxplot, heatmap, and pairplot.
    Applied attractive themes and color palettes for clearer visuals.

Understood the purpose of data visualization for identifying patterns and relationships in data.

Applied concepts by:

    Loading a dataset using Pandas.
    Creating scatter plots to analyze relationships between numerical features.
    Using histograms to understand data distributions.
    Using boxplots to identify distributions and outliers across categories.
    Generating heatmaps to visualize correlations among numeric features.

Learned to handle errors like string columns in correlation matrices by subsetting numeric columns.

Gained confidence in using Matplotlib and Seaborn for analysis and reporting.
