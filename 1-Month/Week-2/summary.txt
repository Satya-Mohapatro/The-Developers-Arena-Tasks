Learned about data structures in Python:

    Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets for organizing and managing data.

Understood functions for writing reusable blocks of code.

Learned lambda functions for writing small, one-line functions quickly.

Explored recursion to solve problems by calling a function within itself.

Practiced list comprehensions for creating and filtering lists in a concise way.

Applied concepts by:

    Removing duplicates from a list using set.
    Filtering data using loops and conditions.
    Writing a data cleaning script that:
        Removes duplicates from data.
        Filters data based on a threshold.

Gained confidence in using data structures and functions for basic data cleaning tasks.
