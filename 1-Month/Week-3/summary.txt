Learned NumPy basics:

    Created and worked with arrays for numerical data.
    Performed element-wise operations (addition, mean, multiplication).
    Understood broadcasting for efficient operations on arrays of different shapes.

Learned Pandas basics:

    Used Series (1D labeled data) and DataFrames (2D tables) for data handling.
    Practiced indexing and selecting rows/columns in DataFrames.
    Handled missing values using dropna() and fillna().
    Learned grouping and aggregation using groupby() to compute summaries.

Applied concepts by:

    Loading a dataset in Pandas.
    Cleaning data by removing missing values.
    Calculating the average of a numeric column.
    Grouping data by a categorical column to calculate mean and count.

Gained confidence in using NumPy and Pandas for real-world data cleaning and analysis.
