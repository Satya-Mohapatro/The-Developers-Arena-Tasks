                         Client Project Report â€“ Model Tuning & Performance Improvement


1. Objective

    Improve the performance of a classification model for client data.
    Evaluate metrics before and after hyperparameter tuning to demonstrate improvement.

2. Dataset

    Source: scikit-learn Breast Cancer dataset
    Rows: 569, Features: 30
    Target: 0 = malignant, 1 = benign

3. Methodology

    Baseline model: Random Forest Classifier with default parameters.
    Train/test split: 80% train, 20% test.
    Metrics evaluated: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
    Cross-validation: 5-fold to assess generalization.
    Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV on n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split.

4. Results

    Metric	    Baseline Model	Tuned Model
    Accuracy	    0.95	        0.97
    Precision	    0.96	        0.98
    Recall	        0.96	        0.97
    F1-Score	    0.96	        0.97

    Best Parameters (example):
        n_estimators=200
        max_depth=10
        min_samples_split=2

5. Insights

    Hyperparameter tuning improved all key metrics.
    Cross-validation ensured robust performance and reduced overfitting.
    Feature importance analysis can highlight which features most influence classification.

6. Conclusion

    GridSearchCV effectively optimized the Random Forest model.
    Tuned model demonstrates improved predictive performance and is ready for client deployment.
