                        Client Project Report – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

1. Introduction
    The objective of this project is to build a prediction model for house prices. Since no dataset was provided by the client, we used the California Housing dataset available in scikit-learn. This dataset contains information about housing features (income, rooms, age, location) and corresponding house prices.

2. Data Overview

    Rows: 20,640
    Features: 8 numerical predictors
    Target: Median house value (in units of $100,000)
    Features Used:
        Median Income (MedInc)
        House Age (HouseAge)
        Average Rooms (AveRooms)
        Average Bedrooms (AveBedrms)
        Population (Population)
        Average Occupancy (AveOccup)
        Latitude & Longitude (geographic info)

3. Methodology

    Loaded dataset using fetch_california_housing.
    Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
    Trained Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.
    Evaluated predictions using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
    Analyzed feature coefficients to interpret importance.

4. Results

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~0.53
    R² Score: ~0.60 (model explains ~60% of variance in house prices).
    Feature Importance (Top Predictors):
        Median Income (MedInc) → strongest positive impact on house prices.
        Latitude & Longitude → strong geographic influence.
        Average Rooms (AveRooms) → moderate positive influence.

5. Insights

    Income is the most significant driver of house prices. Higher income areas have higher housing prices.
    Geographic location (latitude, longitude) is strongly tied to pricing, showing the effect of urban vs rural areas.
    House age and population have weaker correlations compared to income and location.

6. Conclusion
    The model successfully predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy (R² ≈ 0.60). Although Linear Regression works as a baseline, more complex models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) could improve performance.
