Title
    Comparing Two Business Strategies Using Welch’s t-test

Objective
    To determine whether Strategy A and Strategy B differ significantly in terms of the chosen KPI (mean radius feature from scikit-learn breast cancer dataset).

Data

    Source: scikit-learn Breast Cancer dataset (569 samples, 30 features).
    KPI: “mean radius” (continuous feature).
    Random split into two groups: Strategy A (≈50%) and Strategy B (≈50%).

Methodology

    Applied Welch’s two-sample t-test (does not assume equal variances).
    Calculated 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the difference in means.
    Effect size measured using Cohen’s d.

Results

    Strategy A mean KPI: 14.059 (n=275)
    Strategy B mean KPI: 14.191 (n=294)
    Mean difference (B - A): 0.132
    95% CI for difference: [-0.450, 0.714]
    Welch t-test: t=-0.446, p=0.6556
    Cohen's d (effect size): 0.037

Interpretation

    If p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the two strategies yield significantly different KPI averages.
    Effect size (Cohen’s d) indicates magnitude (small ~0.2, medium ~0.5, large ~0.8).

Conclusion
    Strategy B shows [significantly higher/no significant difference] in KPI compared to Strategy A.
    This suggests [adopt Strategy B / more data needed before decision].
