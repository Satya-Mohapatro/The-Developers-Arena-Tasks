Objective:
    To build and evaluate an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time series forecasting, focusing on stock price prediction.

Project Overview:

    Goal: Predict next-day stock prices using historical data.
    Dataset: Apple (AAPL) historical stock prices (2018–2024) downloaded via Yahoo Finance
    Model Used: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers.
    Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

Data Collection & Preprocessing:

    Fetched stock price data using yfinance.
    Selected the “Close” price and normalized values (0–1 range).
    Created time sequences (60-day lookback window).

Model Development:

    Designed a two-layer LSTM network followed by Dense layers.
    Used Adam optimizer and mean_squared_error loss.

Training & Evaluation:
    Trained for 20 epochs with early stopping.
    Evaluated model using MSE and visualized training/validation loss.
    Plotted Actual vs Predicted stock prices to assess performance.

Results:
    The LSTM model effectively captured stock price trends.
    The prediction curve closely followed the actual stock price movement.
    Demonstrated LSTM’s ability to learn temporal dependencies in time series data.

Tools & Technologies:
    Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)
